# Supervised machine learning

This lab focuses on classification problems using supervised machine learning. We will consider both structured and natural language datasets.

## Setup the environment

- Clone the repository `https://gitlab.inf.unibz.it/iap2324-group/lab06-GROUP` on your machine, where GROUP has to be replaced with the name of your group (e.g., black, yellow, etc.)
- Activate the `conda` environment with `conda activate iap`.

## Tasks

The `supervised` directory contains the following Jupyter notebooks:

- `1 Data manipulation and visualisation.ipynb`
- `2 Classification with Iris dataset.ipynb`
- `3 Titanic data classification.ipynb`

Notebooks 1 and 2 introduce the Python tools we use for applying machine learning techniques to solve classification problems, while 3 is the actual problems that require you to apply these techniques.

If you're already familiar with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) you can ignore the first notebook and go through notebook 2 before tackling the assignment in nootebook 3.

## Submission

Write a `README.md` file in the working directory describing your code and how to use it, then push your solution to the GitLab server.

**This lab will not be part of the evaluation!**
